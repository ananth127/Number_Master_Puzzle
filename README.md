# 🎮 Number_Master_Puzzle

A fun logic-based puzzle game where players match cells based on two main rules:
1. **Same Value Rule** – Match cells that have the same number.
2. **Sum-10 Rule** – Match cells whose values add up to 10.

The twist? You can only match cells following a **Z-pattern** across the board — no mirrored or reverse Z allowed!

## 🧠 Game Rules

### ✅ Valid Match Rules
- Match only in **Z-pattern** (normal Z, not mirrored).
- Can match if:
  - Both cells have the **same value**, OR
  - The **sum of both values = 10**.
- Validation always checks **head-to-tail order**, even if the user selects tail first.
- When wrapping to the next row, checking starts from the **first playable cell** in that row.
- For 5 rows, only compare the **first value of row 1** and the **last value of row 5** for edge wrap validation.

### ❌ Invalid Match Rules
- Reverse or mirrored Z-patterns are not considered valid.
- Random connections between non-adjacent rows are ignored.

## 🧩 Game Flow

1. Player selects two cells.
2. System checks if the connection forms a valid **Z-pattern**.
3. Valid if **same value** or **sum = 10**.
4. Non-valid patterns are rejected with a shake animation.
5. Score updates and matched cells disappear.
